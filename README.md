# scl-cli

This repository was created to move the basic building blocks of SCL - Sanskrit Computational Linguistic Tools, and make it into a dockerized REST API.

This was to improve accessibility and build on top of it. The steps involved were:
1. Understand .lex and .yacc file interactions and compilability.
2. Understand perl file interactions with inputs and streamline it.
3. Build a Python logic layer to link everything and make it accessible.
4. Build a NodeJS server layer that queries the python layer and returns outputs after taking inputs.

This project took me a week to complete. Any contributions to improve features are welcome.
